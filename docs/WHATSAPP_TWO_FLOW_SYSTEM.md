# WhatsApp Integration - Two Flow System

## Overview

The WhatsApp integration now supports two distinct flows for phone number setup:

## üöÄ Flow 1: New Twilio Number (Recommended - Default)

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Instant Setup** - No migration downtime
- ‚úÖ **No WhatsApp Deletion** - Keep your existing WhatsApp
- ‚úÖ **Immediate Activation** - Ready to use right away
- ‚úÖ **Professional Number** - Dedicated business line

### How It Works
1. User selects "Get New Twilio Number" (default option)
2. System fetches available numbers based on country
3. User chooses from available numbers (~$1/month)
4. System automatically purchases and configures the number
5. WhatsApp Business API is immediately active

### Technical Implementation
- **API**: `/api/twilio/phone-numbers` (GET for available, POST to purchase)
- **Twilio Integration**: Uses `availablePhoneNumbers` and `incomingPhoneNumbers.create()`
- **Database**: `number_flow: 'new'`, `status: 'active'`, `connected: true`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Flow 2: Existing Number Migration

### Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Number Ownership** - Must own the number, SMS/voice capable
- ‚ùå **WhatsApp Account Deletion** - Must delete current WhatsApp presence
- üïì **Wait Period** - 24-48 hours for Meta systems to release number
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Service Disruption** - Number cannot receive messages during migration

### Migration Steps
1. **Pre-Migration Checklist**:
   - Ensure number is SMS/voice capable
   - Verify not shared with another Meta Business account
   - Backup important WhatsApp data

2. **WhatsApp Account Deletion**:
   - Open WhatsApp Business app
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete My Account
   - This completely wipes current WhatsApp presence

3. **Wait for Release**:
   - Meta systems need to release the number
   - Can take anywhere from minutes to 48 hours
   - Number cannot receive messages during this time

4. **API Migration**:
   - System attempts to register number with Twilio
   - Configures webhooks and messaging service
   - Number becomes API-controllable

### Technical Implementation
- **Database**: `number_flow: 'existing'`, `status: 'pending_migration'`, `connected: false`
- **User Flow**: Extensive warnings and confirmation steps
- **UI**: Orange warning colors, detailed migration steps displayed
