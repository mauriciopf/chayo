# API Refactoring Summary: Agent-Based to Organization-Based

## 🎯 **Goal**
Refactor the API structure to be business/organization-focused rather than agent-focused, since agents represent businesses in our system.

## 📁 **Before: Agent-Based Structure**
```
app/api/agents/[id]/
├── route.ts                    # Agent CRUD (PUT/DELETE) ✅ KEEP
├── conversations/route.ts      # ❌ REMOVED - moved to organizations
├── memory/route.ts            # ❌ REMOVED - moved to organizations  
├── whatsapp-setup/route.ts    # ❌ REMOVED - moved to organizations
└── business-info-fields/      # ❌ EMPTY - moved to organizations
```

## 📁 **After: Organization-Based Structure**
```
app/api/organizations/[id]/
├── conversations/route.ts      # ✅ NEW - conversation management
├── memory/route.ts            # ✅ NEW - memory management
├── whatsapp-setup/route.ts    # ✅ NEW - WhatsApp integration
└── business-info-fields/      # ✅ EXISTING - business info management
```

## 🔄 **Routes Refactored**

### **1. Conversations API**
- **Old**: `/api/agents/{agentId}/conversations`
- **New**: `/api/organizations/{organizationId}/conversations`
- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve business conversations
- **Access Control**: Organization membership via `team_members` table

### **2. Memory API**
- **Old**: `/api/agents/{agentId}/memory`
- **New**: `/api/organizations/{organizationId}/memory`
- **Purpose**: Manage business knowledge and memory conflicts
- **Access Control**: Organization membership via `team_members` table

### **3. WhatsApp Setup API**
- **Old**: `/api/agents/{agentId}/whatsapp-setup`
- **New**: `/api/organizations/{organizationId}/whatsapp-setup`
- **Purpose**: Configure WhatsApp Business integration
- **Access Control**: Organization membership via `team_members` table

## ✅ **Routes Kept (Agent-Specific)**

### **Agent CRUD Operations**
- **Route**: `/api/agents/{agentId}` (PUT/DELETE)
- **Purpose**: Update agent settings (name, greeting, tone, goals, system_prompt)
- **Reason**: These are truly agent-specific configurations

### **Agent Management**
- **Route**: `/api/agents` (GET/POST)
- **Purpose**: List and create agents
- **Reason**: Agent lifecycle management

## 🔐 **Access Control Changes**

### **Before (Agent-Based)**
```typescript
// Verify agent belongs to user
const { data: agent, error: agentError } = await supabase
  .from('agents')
  .select('id, name, organization_id')
  .eq('id', agentId)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()
```

### **After (Organization-Based)**
```typescript
// Verify user has access to organization
const { data: membership, error: membershipError } = await supabase
  .from('team_members')
  .select('organization_id, role')
  .eq('organization_id', organizationId)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('status', 'active')
  .single()
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of Refactoring**

1. **Business-Centric**: All business operations are now under organizations
2. **Team Access**: Uses existing team membership system for access control
3. **Scalability**: Supports multiple team members per organization
4. **Consistency**: Aligns with the "one agent = one business" model
5. **Future-Proof**: Ready for multi-agent organizations if needed

## 📚 **Updated Documentation**

- `examples/business_conversation_import.md` - Updated API endpoints
- `docs/WRITABLE_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md` - Updated memory API endpoints
- `docs/API_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## 🧪 **Testing**

Created `scripts/test_organization_conversations.js` to verify:
- Organization-based conversation storage
- Memory management
- Access control via team membership

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**

- **Backward Compatibility**: Old agent-based routes have been removed
- **Frontend Updates**: Any frontend code using old routes needs updating
- **Database**: No schema changes required, just API structure changes
- **Embedding Service**: Already uses organization_id, so no changes needed

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. Update any frontend components using old agent-based routes
2. Test the new organization-based routes thoroughly
3. Update any external integrations or documentation
4. Consider deprecating agent-specific routes if not needed
