## 📝 NOTES

### Why Reservations is NOT an Agent Tool
- **Reason**: It's a product-level feature, not a business capability
- **Benefit**: Simpler UX - one place to control (product form)
- **Benefit**: Automatic menu visibility based on actual product configuration
- **Benefit**: Less code complexity

### Email Notification System
- **Trigger**: Supabase Database Webhook on `reservations_tool` INSERT
- **Handler**: `supabase/functions/send-reservation-confirmation/index.ts`
- **Service**: Resend API
- **Template**: HTML email with reservation details

### Navigation Fix
- **Issue**: `setTimeout` pauses when app goes to background
- **Solution**: Removed all setTimeout, navigation is immediate
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `ReservationCalendarScreen.tsx`
  - `ReservationTimeSelectionScreen.tsx`
